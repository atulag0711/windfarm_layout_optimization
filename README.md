This repository contains scripts and data for windfarm layout optimization using our proposed optimization algorithm SCOUT-Nd (Stochastic Constrained Optimization for N Dimensions) and MF-SCOUT-Nd (Multi-Fidelity Stochastic Constrained Optimization for N Dimensions) [Github](https://github.com/KislayaRavi/scout-Nd/}{Github}). The primary goal of wind farm layout optimization is to position the wind turbines to reduce interference and thus maximize power production. This is a challenging and complex problem due to the variable nature of the wind and the complex interactions between turbines through their wakes.
